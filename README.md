# WeatherB 
A weather app built with AngularJs, Node, Express, and the Ionic Framework.

### Purpose
This app was a short project I created during my apprenticeship at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) in order to get a better understandng of Express, Angular, Node and Ionic.

### Features
WeatherB displays current weather conditions and a five-day forcast relative to a device's latitude and longitude. A user is also able to search for a city name, state, or zip code, and WeatherB then outputs the previously stated weather information relative to user input.

### Local Use
If you want to run this app locally/get it on your machine -
  1. Git clone onto your local machine/repository( via HTTPS) - ``` git clone https://github.com/bbleds/Ionic-weather-app.git```
  2. Go into the new cloned directory - ``` cd Ionic-weather-app ```
  3. Install packages required by this app - 
    ```
    npm install
    ```
  4. Run express server, and you're done! (after running, go to localhost:5000 in your browser to view) - 
    ```

    ```
