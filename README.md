# WeatherB 
A weather app built with AngularJs, Node.js, Express, and the Ionic Framework.
Take a test drive at [http://weather-b.herokuapp.com](http://weather-b.herokuapp.com/#/main)!

### Purpose
This app was a short project I created during my apprenticeship at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/) in order to get a better understandng of Express, Angular, Node and Ionic.

### Features
WeatherB displays current weather conditions and a five-day forcast relative to a device's latitude and longitude. A user is also able to search for a city name, state, or zip code, and WeatherB then outputs the previously stated weather information relative to user input.
